Risk-sensitive optimal asset management in Matlab
=================================================

Matlab classes to simulate the HJB (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman) equation arising from the stochastic control in [this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1379 "Research paper") research paper by Mark Davis and Sebastien Lleo. This code was written as part of my thesis for the [MSc in Mathematical Finance](http://maths.york.ac.uk/www/onlinemscmathfin "MSc in Mathematical Finance") from the University of York.

Usage
=====

See example files provided in folder `samples`. The result of executing the 2-factor example produces the following grahs:
